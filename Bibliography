Article describing text classification using word2vec models, where each word is represented by vector in a large vector space.
Those vectors hold some interesting properties (words with similiar semanting meaning are represented by vectors which are close to each other),
this allows for classification of texts based on, e.g., average distance of vectors in an article etc...
