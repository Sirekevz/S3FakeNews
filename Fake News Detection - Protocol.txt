Fake News Detection:

focus on text, maybe also short text like tweets

Remark from Mark: Fakenews are better classified when looking on how they spread instead of the content itself
Lucia: with graph search/theory: build up a graph of the "way" of news

Assign level of "Fakeness"

Decision: Detect fake news itself (the news/tweet etc) or the author of fake news?
	GO FOR THE FAKE NEWS DETECTION BASED ON CONTENT
	

	
	
Possible Parameters/Identification/Differentiation methods:
	Differences in the Word Count, Letter COunt, Specific words that appear more often than others?
	Differences in the Topics itself? --> Are there more fake news for one specific topic than for others?
	What about satire? how to detect that?
